# Confounded Cuisiner
Group recipes into different cuisines using their ingredients list. 

## Dataset
Dataset consists of ingredients list for 39744 recipes

## Approach
Implemented a Topic modelling approach using LDA algorithm. The model was trained to classify recipes into eight cuisines based on the probabilities of the ingredients appearing in the recipes.  The number of cuisines (eight) was selected based on the coherence analysis.
